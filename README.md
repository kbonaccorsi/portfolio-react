This application is my personal portfolio.  It opens to the homepage, and has a navigation bar that takes the user through different pages.  The contact page will (in the future) allow a user to send an email directly to me.  The portfolio page is separated into sections that can be accessed by scrolling, or clicking on section buttons.  Each section has sample projects that have been completed along with functioning buttons to take a user to the github repo and either a live deployment or a walkthrough video.  The resume page displays a button to download my resume.
